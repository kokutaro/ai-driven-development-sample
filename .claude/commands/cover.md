# Think hard to implement the test which covers following method or file

## Method or file

- $ARGUMENTS

## Task

1. Create the branch `test/<branch name>`
2. Think hard to plan the test which covers normal and error pattern and edge case
3. For the coding, follow the @ai-rules/coding-guidelines.md to write the robust and well structured code.
4. Show test plan to user
5. When user approve, do the task
6. Every code change, use MCP:ESLint to lint the code which you have modified.
7. Do `yarn format`, `yarn lint`, `yarn typecheck`, `yarn test`
8. Commit the changes if all checks in 6. are passed. Don't compromise about testing. Never commit the changes with errors
9. Push to the remote
10. Create PR

## Note

Target of each small test's coverage are 100%
Need justifications if the test can't cover 100%
